# TypeScript & React Examples

This examples are intended to create familiarity with the basic principles of Typescript and using Typescript with React.

The examples were created as part of a talk on TypeScript & React for the [React Medellin Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/React-Medellin/events/262881031/).

## Slides

The slides for the presentation used with this examples are in [http://bit.ly/tsReact](http://bit.ly/tsReact)

## Using the Code

There are two ways to use the code to play & learn Typescript:

- Using CodeSandbox online editor
- Cloning this repo on your computer

### Using CodeSandbox

You can visit this repo in [CodeSandbox](http://bit.ly/tsSandbox) and you'll able to follow the examples without installing any additional software.

### Cloning this repo

#### 1. Install an Editor with TypeScript support

You'll need an editor with TypeScript support on your computer, I recommend [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) which includes support for TypeScript by default.

In this [link](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Editor-Support) you'll find information on how to add support for TypeScript to your editor if you're not using VisualStudio code.

### 2. Clone this repo and install dependencies

Execute the following command in a terminal to clone the repository and install the dependencies needed for the examples:

```
git clone https://github.com/elyalvarado/typescript-examples
cd typescript-examples
yarn install
```
